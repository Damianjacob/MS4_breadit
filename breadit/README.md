# MS4_breadit

## A forum for bakers and bread enthusiasts

## Project Goals
The goals for this project are:

- Creating a forum where users can talk and discuss about baking
- Users can sign up and log in to take advantage of the main features
- Users can create, update and delete their posts. They can also engage with posts of other users by liking them and commenting.

My own goals for this project are:
- Creating a user-friendly and simple application
- Improving my skills of web development, especially regarding frameworks(Django), back-end development and python.

## User Goals
- Find information or recipes about baking
- Discuss bakery-related things with other users
- Share recipes, pictures or advice with other users

## Site Owner Goals
- Keep the site friendly and secure by having access to the admin panel, where it's possible to delete posts, comments and users should it be necessary.

<!-- There is one error because of an empty form label on index.html, however i need that label to stay empty for my responsive nav bar to show correctly as a hamburger menu.  The same goes for the instruments.html page in the buy modal: there are empty labels because i used icons from font awesome for those labels. -->
